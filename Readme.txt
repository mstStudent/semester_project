How to use this app
Usage:
  Unzip and navigate into the 'test' folder.
  Run 'run_server.sh'.
  Open the listed page (should be 'http://localhost:5000").
  This is the home page and you can always get back there by clicking 'Home' at the top or going to the root URL.
  Pastebox/UserName:
    By default (on the root page or '/user/default/'), the username will be 'temp' to designate a temporary workspace.
    While that is a valid user, please type in another one if you want it to last.
  <Now, all that is left is instructions for using your part of the project.>
