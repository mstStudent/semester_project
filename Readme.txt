How to use Sean's backend for this app.
Usage:
  Navigate the command prompt into the main/code folder.
  Run python ../test2.py
  Open the listed page (should be 'http://localhost:5000").
  This is the home page and you can always get back there by clicking 'Home' at the top or going to the root URL.
  Pastebox/UserName:
    By default (on the root page or '/user/default/'), the username will be 'temp' to designate a temporary workspace.
    While that is a valid user, please type in another one if you want it to last.
  <Now, all that is left is instructions for using your part of the project.>

WARNING:
	The backend server (save feature) requires a default.json to be in main/code otherwise the save will only half work.
