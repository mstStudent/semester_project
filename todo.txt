Bugs:

Features:
Add drag & drop
change navigation from double click to something else for mobile
find a way to simplify drawTree
get rid of the JSON area, replace with download button
center interface in window

Architecture:
migrate to Apache - Apache or Apache2 or Lighttpd?
migrate to mySQL - which is better for this mySQL or postgresql?
migrate from pure html w/js to a web-frame w/js (like bootstrap or something) it
could solve the mobile compatibility and help with making things look "pretty"
